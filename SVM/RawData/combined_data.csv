Clutching her books

Coming in from a late night out.

All his work was through  
  
Then the children of paradise  
Did the only thing they really shouldn't do  
  
Children of paradise  
We started out there  
Full of innocence in our eyes  
And without a care  
  
We are children of paradise  
We knew of no crime  
Until one of the meanest lies  
Has changed our time  
  
It was long ago  
In the early morning glow  
When it all began with Adam and Eve  
They were young and free  
And for all eternity  
They were meant to feel  
No trouble no grief  
  
Children of paradise  
  
We're the children of paradise  
In search of the light  
  
That was put in paradise  
And started the night  
  
It was long ago  
  
We are children of paradise  
  
We are the children of paradise  
Who didn't obey  
When we followed the wrong advise  
We wandered astray  
We are the children of paradise  
In search of the light

But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and I laughed  
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do

Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue  
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you

And cold nights make staying alert so hard  
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard  
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay  
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?  
  
Small town hearts of the New Year  
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear  
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier

With new taste for speed, out on the street  
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet  
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow  
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know

And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins

That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone  
  
Your nerves gather with the altitude  
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued  
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood  
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway  
The high tide could take me so far away  
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day  
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age  
Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align  
  
We were the crashing whitecaps  
On the ocean  
And what lovely seaside holiday, away  
A palm tree in Christmas lights  
My emotion  
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone  
As we spent the day alone  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins

Floating in love's atmosphere

Just for you.

You've got the key baby open me.

Your body's steaming,  
You want it baby, this is your night.  
I keep arising, I'm fantasizing,  
  
I want it so bad I'll do what you like.  
We can do it in the movies,  
Or in my jacuzzi,  
Or maybe Central Park.  
  
So if there's any doubt,  
To what I'm all about,  
So tell your friends I'm turning you out.

I got a letter from a dear friend of mine,  
The story of a spiritual awakening.  
She spoke of her love returning in kind,  
She let me know that she'd be waiting.  
And I should be on my way by now.  
Walking across the floor,  
Reaching for the door, on my way by now.  
  
But here I sit,  
Country fool that I am,  
My elbow on my knee  
And my chin in my hand.  
My mind in the gutter  
And my eye on the street,  
Holed up in a cave of concrete.  
And I ought to be on my way right now.  
Packing my things  
While the telephone rings,  
On my way right now.  
  
I miss my lovely mother  
And I love my lonely father.  
I know I owe my brothers one thing  
And another, I hear my sister singing.  
And I ought to be on my way right now.  
Moving across the land  
With my heart in my hand,  
On my way by now,  
Ought to be on my way by now.  
  
Oh, end this day,  
Set me in motion.  
Ought to be on my way.  
  
Out to the west  
Of Lambert's Cove,  
There's a sail out in the sun.  
And I'm on board  
Though very small,  
I've come home to stop yearning.  
Burn off the haze  
Around the shore,  
Turn off the crazy way I feel.  
I'll stay away from you no more,  
I've come home to stop yearning.

And we carried them around either with

And when we meet - they meet other lines of people  
And we say bring together the lines of me  
  
When I look back over the years  
At the things that brought tears to my eyes

To live long lives

Would it be remiss to continue in this way  
Would you rather I quit

Making people's hips sway  
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous  
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep  
Like a lifeline, I light lines

For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep

Hello Dad,  
Remember me?  
I'm the man you thought I'd never be.  
I'm the boy who you  
Reduced to tears  
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years  
Yeah, that's right  
My name Rob  
I'm the one  
Who landed the popstar's job  
I'm the one who  
You told look, don't touch  
I'm the kid  
Who wouldn't amount too much.  
  
I believe in the senses that I sound  
I have always been too loud  
Won't you help me drown it out?  
And When I feel  
What I'm feeling is so real  
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel  
Always digging in my heels  
Now I got the faith to  
  
Fall back again  
Crawl from the warm water  
Water to air  
You're on your feet again  
Your feet again.  
  
Ha, lace up your booty  
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude  
Feed freakin' for loot  
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now  
And your forefathers further know how  
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred  
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread  
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best  
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth  
  
This is what my Daddy told me  
I wished he would hold me  
A little more  
than he did  
But he told me my culture  
And how to live positive

Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree  
Hanging on a branch up under the sun  
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne  
Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain  
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain  
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive  
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive  
Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail  
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail  
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree  
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me  
An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight  
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight  
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge  
Coming all the way from India on a local barge  
Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den  
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins  
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down  
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds  
Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut  
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut  
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross  
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw  
Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in  
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in  
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day  
He couldn't understand how Leo got away  
Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news  
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos  
A hoot owl reported everything he saw  
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw  
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised  
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues  
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down  
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground  
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat  
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet  
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes  
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize  
Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground  
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds  
Leo got back to the square of the fight  
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight

It was February 14 Valentine's Day  
The roses came but they took you away  
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm  
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone  
  
And I'll never get to show you these songs  
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on  
I see you standing there next to Mom  
Both singing along, yeah on and on  
  
And there are days when I'm losing my faith  
Because the man wasn't good he was great  
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""  
And explained I was young, he would say  
  
Take that rage, put it on a page  
Take that page to the stage  
Blow the roof off the place  
I'm trying to make you proud  
Do everything you did  
I hope you're up there with God saying ""That's my kid!""

Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
If you could see me now would you recognize me?  
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?  
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face  
Put your hand on my heart that was cold  
As the day you were taken away  
  
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day  
Right now, I wish I could hear you say  
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch  
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must  
  
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me  
Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it  
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom  
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son  
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out  
So if you get a second to look down on me now  
  
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
Oh, oh  
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?  
Would you love me a loser or winner?  
Oh, oh  
When I see my face in the mirror  
We look so alike that it makes me shiver  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now

Still at my side

The constant road across the wilderness

The memory of God

Maybe not in my lifetime  
But in yours I feel sure

Quiet as a sleeping army  
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven  
For the mother's restless son  
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior  
Who denies his urge to break and run  
  
Who says: Hard times?  
I'm used to them  
The speeding planet burns  
I'm used to that  
My life's so common it disappears  
And sometimes even music  
Cannot substitute for tears

the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me I  
Believe""  
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave""  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

And nobody cares about your paranoid trip  
You know death and the devil sure got it easy today  
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away  
You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive  
What makes you think that the weak survive  
And if you don't have the stomach  
For all this radical crap  
Then have the guts to stand for something  
Or you're gonna be trapped

Trapped in a world that you never made

Not like Buddha not like Vishnu  
Life wouldn't rise through him again

That he might question his beliefs  
The beginning of the Last Temptation

The duality of nature, Godly nature,  
Human nature splits the soul  
Fully human, fully divine and divided  
The great immortal soul  
  
Split into pieces, whirling pieces, opposites  
Attract  
From the front, the side, the back  
The mind itself attacks  
  
I know the feeling, I know it from before  
Descartes through Hegel belief is never sure

The Mysteries of Life  
Outside the city shrieking screaming whispering  
The Mysteries of Life  
  
There's a funeral tomorrow  
At St. Patrick's the bells will ring for you  
Ah, what must you have been thinking  
When you realized the time had come for you  
  
I wish I hadn't thrown away my time  
On so much Human and so much less Divine

Climbing the stairs to talk to you  
Comin' to tell his story  
Every single one of which is true  
Hello, Lukas  
I'm please to meet you, now how do you do?  
  
So they go driving  
Out to the river like lovers do  
You smell out the summer  
Baby, the summer just smells of you  
One day, I'm gonna be a famous writer  
Some book like love in the afternoon  
It was all Lukas could say  
Maybe one day, we could run away, run away  
  
I thought we never last  
I thought we never last  
  
Now here comes Lukas  
He done everything he wanna do  
It was twenty years later  
Come back to do what he promised to  
He come back to make her happy  
But these things don't always wait for you  
And poor Lukas was late  
That's when he got back, she'll be married today  
Gone away  
  
I thought we never last  
I thought we never last  
  
And Lukas would say  
For a million lonely people  
Another long gone  
For a million hearts that opened  
A million break  
And the world's just a fallen angel in my way  
I'm up in heaven, you can hear them say  
Lookin' for Lukas but Lukas was always runnin' away

But night has clouded over  
No spark of constellation  
No Vela no Orion  
  
The shells upon the warm sands  
Have taken from their own lands  
The echo of their story  
But all I hear are low sounds  
As pillow words are weaving  
And willow waves are leaving  
But should I be believing  
That I am only dreaming  
  
You go there you're gone forever  
I go there I'll lose my way  
If we stay here we're not together  
Anywhere is  
  
To leave the tread of all time  
And let it make a dark line  
In hopes that I can still find  
The way back to the moment  
I took the turn and turned to  
Begin a new beginning  
Still looking for the answer  
I cannot find the finish  
It's either this or that way  
It's one way or the other  
It should be one direction  
It could be on reflection  
The turn I have just taken  
The turn that I was making  
I might be just beginning  
I might be near the end.

Can you hear my call?  
This hurt that I've been through  
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?  
And make sure you're alright  
I'll take care of you  
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes  
And we both still got room left to grow  
And though love sometimes hurts  
I still put you first

Then we head back to hell again  
We kiss then we make up on the way  
  
I hang up, you call  
We rise and we fall  
And we feel like just walking away  
As our love advances we take second chances  
Though it's not a fantasy I still want you to stay

With my momma's mason jar  
Caught a lovely Butterfly  
  
When I woke up today  
And looked in on my fairy pet  
She had withered all away  
No more sighing in her breast  
I'm sorry for what I did  
I did what my body told me to  
I didn't mean to do you harm  
But everytime I pin down what I think I want  
It slips away - the ghost slips away  
  
I smell you on my hand for days  
I can't wash away your scent  
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch  
  
I guess you're as real as me  
Maybe I can live with that  
Maybe I need fantasy  
A life of chasing Butterfly  
I told you I would return  
When the robin makes his nest  
But I ain't never comin' back  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul

Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kick out  
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out  
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed  
Scarce chapter, snatcher batcher went to fresh  
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich  
You get buckshot, dumb be clapped, mummy wrapped and stitched  
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Damer sing the song the strongest  
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus  
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut  
A can of ass whoopin' flurry shake, break you fucks  
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin' hooks  
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book  
This death bent doctrine, paper for the youth  
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth  
  
Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights  
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight  
I detect that parasite, satellite  
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows  
My slang sound write secretary type  
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man  
Workin' hard for the grand, I understand clear  
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours  
My style drop like jaws, you see me on tours  
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street  
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack  
Wu article CappaFive, CD attack  
But my talk stage live killa beehive  
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts  
Bring the gold dangle, never make me throw darts  
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts  
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts

This scared hard-edged rat race

Borderlines

Every fashion-plated rage  
Every measure, every gauge  
Creates a borderline  
Every stone thrown through glass  
Every mean-streets-kick ass  
Every swan caught on the grass  
Will draw a borderline

You snub so snide--  
So ripe and ready

But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk  
A modern man accumulates  
I'm a statistic in a system  
That a civil servant dominates  
And all that means is that I'm running on ice  
Caught in the vise so strong  
I'm slipping and sliding, cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
As fast as I can climb  
A new disaster every time I turn around  
As soon as I get one fire put out  
There's another building burning down  
They say this highway's going my way  
But I don't know where it's taking me  
It's a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race  
It's breaking me  
I get no traction cause I'm running on ice  
It's taking me twice as long  
I get a bad reaction cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice

Had drank so much he could drink no more,  
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain  
To dream that he rode on that down bound train.  
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp  
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp,  
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones  
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans.  
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer  
The devil himself was the engineer,  
The passengers were most a motley crew,  
Some were foreigners and others he knew.  
  
Rich men and lost beggars in rags  
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags.  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace  
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face,  
  
Wider and wider the country grew  
Faster and faster the engine flew,  
Louder and louder the thunder crashed  
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed,  
  
Hotter and hotter the air became  
Til their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain.  
Then out of the din there came a yell  
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home,  
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain  
They go to Satan with this down bound train.  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry  
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high,  
  
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor  
And prayed a prayer like never before.  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain  
For he never rode that down bound train.

Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end  
The low beam room with the window looking out  
On the soft summer garden  
Where the boys grew in the trees  
  
Here I grew guilty  
And no one was at fault  
Frightened by the power in every innocent thought  
And the silent understanding passing down  
From daughter to daughter  
Let the boys grow in the trees  
  
Do you go to them or do you let them come to you  
Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude  
Deny yourself and hope someone will see  
And live like a flower  
While the boys grew in the trees  
  
Last night I slept in sheets the colour of fire  
Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires  
Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze  
And watch by the window  
Where the boys grew in the trees

Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

My sister went there on a Saturday.  
Come dancing,  
All her boyfriends used to come and call.

Another Saturday, another date.  
She would be ready but she'd always make him wait.  
In the hallway, in anticipation,  
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.  
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week  
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.  
Come dancing,  
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,  
And when they said come dancing,  
My sister always did.  
  
My sister should have come in at midnight,  
And my mum would always sit up and wait.  
It always ended up in a big row  
When my sister used to get her own way  
Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight,  
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.  
  
The day they knocked down the palais  
My sister stood and cried.  
The day they knocked down the palais  
Part of my childhood died, just died.  
  
Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,  
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.  
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.  
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.  
She knows they get away with things she never could,  
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,  
Come dancing,  
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.  
Don't be afraid to come dancing,  
It's only natural.  
  
Come dancing,  
Just like the palais on a Saturday.  
And all her friends will come dancing  
Where the big bands used to play.

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house

We're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

And that magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay  
But I'm not fine at all

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed  
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team  
You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And there's nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough  
To forget why I needed to  
  
'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night  
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up  
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well  
  
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it  
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah  
  
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Who ruled Babylon and all its land  
Around the city, he built a wall  
And declared that Babylon would never fall  
He had concubines and wives  
He called his Babylon ""Paradise""  
On his throne he drank and ate  
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late  
  
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand  
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His houses were built upon the sand  
  
Well, the people feasted and drank their wine  
And praised the false gods of his time  
All holy things they scorned and mocked  
But suddenly all their mocking stopped  
For on the wall, there appeared a hand  
Nothin' else, there was no man  
In blood the hand began to write  
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright  
  
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand  
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting

Well, no one around could understand  
What was written by the mystic hand  
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find  
A man who could give him peace of mind  
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God  
He saw the writing on the wall in blood  
Belshazzar asked him what it said  
And Daniel turned to the wall and read:  
  
""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting  
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand  
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting  
Your houses are built upon the sand""

Sky fell down beneath your sandal  
In your eye I began to spin  
  
Winter harlot, moontime lover  
I can't speak when I feel this way  
Don't keep your feelings undercover  
Tell me what you want today  
Don't leave me in the air to hover  
Sing it out don't make me suffer  
Don't be ashamed love is no sin  
  
Springtime woman, sunrise girl  
I am hiding behind the sea  
Trick or treat, the Hallowe'en world  
Hide and seek but you can't catch me  
I won't chase you until you hurl  
Your wing to me, and make me twirl  
You're alive underneath my skin

When he says the words  
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him  
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you  
'Til the end of time  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
If you told me to cry for you, I could  
If you told me to die for you, I would  
Take a look at my face  
There's no price I won't pay  
To say these words to you  
  
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice  
But baby, if you give me just one more try  
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,  
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
Always

On a gallant whaling ship  
Was the second Sunday morning  
Just after leaving port  
We met a heavy sou'west gale  
And washed away our boat  
It washed away our quarterdeck  
Our stanchions just as well  
And so we set the whole shebang  
A-floatin' in the gale

For the wind was on our quarter  
The engines working free  
There's not another whaler  
That sails the arctic sea

You need not try my sons  
We challenged all both great and small  
From Dundee to St John's  
  
Art Jackman set his canvas  
Fair Weather galloped steam  
And Captain Guy, the daring boy  
Came plunging through the stream  
And Mullins in the Husky  
Tried to beat the bloody lot  
But to beat the Old Polina boys  
Was something he could not

Where rum is very cheap  
We'll drink a health of Captain Guy

You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street,  
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.  
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,  
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.  
  
And after a while, you can work on points for style.  
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,  
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.  
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,  
So that when they turn their backs on you,  
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.  
  
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.  
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older.  
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,  
Hide your head in the sand,  
Just another sad old man,  
All alone and dying of cancer.  
  
And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown.  
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.  
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around.  
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,  
Dragged down by the stone.  
  
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused.  
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used.  
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.  
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?  
  
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending  
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend.  
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  
And everything's done under the sun,  
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.  
  
Who was born in a house full of pain.  
Who was trained not to spit in the fan.  
Who was told what to do by the man.  
Who was broken by trained personnel.  
  
Who was fitted with collar and chain.  
Who was given a pat on the back  
Who was breaking away from the pack.  
Who was only a stranger at home.  
  
Who was ground down in the end.  
Who was found dead on the phone.  
Who was dragged down by the stone.

Rust your bullets with his tears  
Let me tell you 'bout his years

In the smoke, in the mud and lead  
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread  
Soon be time to go over the wall  
Rapid fire and the end of us all  
  
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire  
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire  
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb  
Be reunited with my dead friends soon  
  
Many soldiers eighteen years  
Drown in mud, no more tears  
Surely a war no-one can win  
Killing time about to begin  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
The bodies of ours and our foes  
The sea of death it overflows  
In no man's land, God only knows  
Into jaws of death we go  
  
Crucified as if on a cross  
Allied troops they mourn their loss  
German war propaganda machine  
Such before has never been seen  
  
Swear I heard the angels cry  
Pray to god no more may die  
So that people know the truth  
Tell the tale of Paschendale  
  
Cruelty has a human heart  
Every man does play his part  
Terror of the men we kill  
The human heart is hungry still  
  
I stand my ground for the very last time  
Gun is ready as I stand in line  
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow  
Rush of blood and over we go  
  
Blood is falling like the rain  
Its crimson cloak unveils again  
The sound of guns can't hide their shame  
And so we die on Paschendale  
  
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire  
Running straight at the cannon fire  
Running blind as I hold my breath  
Say a prayer symphony of death  
  
As we charge the enemy lines  
A burst of fire and we go down  
I choke a cry but no-one hears  
Fell the blood go down my throat  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
See my spirit on the wind  
Across the lines, beyond the hill  
Friend and foe will meet again  
Those who died at Paschendale

Who said they were through with dealing  
Every time you gave them shelter  
I know that kind of man  
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone  
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender  
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender.  
  
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind  
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter  
Like any dealer he was watching for the card  
That is so high and wild  
He'll never need to deal another  
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger  
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger.  
  
And then leaning on your window sill  
He'll say one day you caused his will  
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter  
And then taking from his wallet  
An old schedule of trains, he'll say  
I told you when I came I was a stranger  
I told you when I came I was a stranger.  
  
But now another stranger seems  
To want you to ignore his dreams  
As though they were the burden of some other  
O you've seen that man before  
His golden arm dispatching cards  
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger  
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter  
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter.  
  
Ah you hate to see another tired man  
Lay down his hand  
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker  
And while he talks his dreams to sleep  
You notice there's a highway  
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder  
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder.  
  
You tell him to come in sit down  
But something makes you turn around  
The door is open you can't close your shelter  
You try the handle of the road  
It opens do not be afraid  
It's you my love, you who are the stranger  
It's you my love, you who are the stranger.  
  
Well, I've been waiting, I was sure  
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for  
I think it's time to board another  
Please understand, I never had a secret chart  
To get me to the heart of this  
Or any other matter  
When he talks like this  
You don't know what he's after  
When he speaks like this,  
You don't know what he's after.  
  
Let's meet tomorrow if you choose  
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge  
That they are building on some endless river  
Then he leaves the platform  
For the sleeping car that's warm  
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter  
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger  
And you say ok the bridge or someplace later.  
  
And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind ...  
  
And leaning on your window sill ...  
  
I told you when I came I was a stranger.

Now it's just the same old joke  
And laughing

When there's nothing to defend

But what you wanna see ain't your memories of me  
So why you turn around tonight  
But I'm already there  
I'm already there

Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV  
  
Well honey I'm just trying to make some sense  
Los Angeles  
Boston gets cold this time of year  
Seems like each day just leaves me numb  
I gotta get out of here  
Go walking in the sun  
  
Well if you see that movie star and me  
Or if you should see my picture in a magazine  
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV  
  
But honey I'm just trying to make some sense  
Honey I'm just trying to make some friends  
Well baby I'm not trying to make amends  
For coming to Los Angeles  
Oh Los Angeles  
  
No more Boston, no more Nashville, no more Oakland  
Oh baby come on out to the sea  
Come on take a walk down Sunset with me  
  
Oh we gonna get drunk, find up some skinny girls, and go street walking  
In Los Angeles!  
  
And man its a really good place to find yourself a taco

Lost in a dream  
Like the echoes of our souls are meeting

I wonder what it means  
What could it be that comes over me  
At times I can't move  
At times I can't hardly breathe

The world goes still, so still inside  
When you say you love me  
For a moment, there's no one else alive  
  
You're the one I've always thought of  
I don't know how but I feel sheltered in your love  
You're where I belong  
And when you're with me if I close my eyes  
There are times I swear I feel like I can fly  
For a moment in time

The heavens and earth  
I'm frozen in time

How far we've come and I  
Celebrate every moment

That's all you have to say  
I'll always feel this way

When you say you love me  
In that moment, I know why I'm alive

When you say you love me  
Do you know how I love you?

So nonchalant  
And spend our nights  
So Bon vivant  
We dress our days  
In silken robes  
The money comes  
The money goes  
We know it's all a passing phase,  
  
We light our lamps  
For atmosphere  
And hang our hopes  
On chandeliers  
We're going wrong  
We're gaining weight  
We're sleeping long  
And far too late  
And so it's time  
To change our ways  
But I've loved these days.  
  
Now as we indulge  
In things refined  
We hide our hearts  
From harder times  
A string of pearls  
A foreign car  
Oh we can only go so far  
On caviar and Cabernet.  
  
We drown our doubts  
In dry champagne  
And soothe our souls  
With fine cocaine  
I don't know why I even care  
We'll get so high  
And get nowhere  
We'll have to change our jaded ways,  
But I've loved these days.  
  
So before we end  
And then begin  
We'll drink a toast to how it's been  
A few more hours to be complete  
A few more nights on satin sheets  
A few more times that I can say,  
I've loved these days.

In the turn of the cheek

In the face of your fear

In a mighty tower

Now we know it's nearly over

But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love

We can't take this any farther  
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change

There we are walking hand in hand,  
Somewhere on the sand  
At the end of the land  
And the edge of the shining sea.  
  
Drifting through time and space  
On the face of a little blue ball  
Falling around the sun.  
One in a million, billion twinkling lights  
Shining out for no one in the middle of the night.  
Here we are, sparks in the darkness,  
Speaking of our love  
Burning down forever and forever.

And I found out something about you, baby,  
Without you.

I love you, darling I do, Carly, I do love you.  
And though we are as nothing  
To the stars that shine above,  
You are my universe, you are my love.  
Here we are, like children forever,  
Taking care of one another  
While the world goes on without us,  
All around us.

I was visited by a majestic hymn  
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky  
Electricity flowing through my veins  
  
I was captured by a larger moment  
I was seized by divinity's hot breath  
Gorged like a lion on experience  
Powerful from life  
  
(I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it)  
All of it

I saw a bird turn into a tiger  
I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes  
In the jungles of the Amazon  
  
I saw a man put a redhot needle through his eye  
Turn into a crow and fly through the trees  
Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames

All of it  
(All of it, all of it, all of it)

We saw the moon vanish into his pocket  
We saw the stars disappear from sight  
We saw him walk across water into the sun  
While bathed in eternal light  
  
We spewed out questions waiting for answers  
Creating legends, religions and myths  
Books, stories, movies and plays  
All trying to explain this  
  
(I wanted all of it, oh, all of it)  
All of it

I saw a great man turn into a little child  
The cancer reduce him to dust  
His voice growing weak as he fought for his life  
With a bravery few men know  
  
I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs  
Trying to stop the cancerous spread  
And it made me think of ""Leda And The Swan""  
And gold being made from lead  
  
The same power that burned Hiroshima  
Causing three legged babies and death  
Shrunk to the size of a nickel  
To help him regain his breath  
  
And I was struck by the power and the glory  
I was visited by a majestic Him  
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky  
As the radiation flowed through him  
  
(I wanted all of it, not just some of it, all of it)  
He wanted all of it  
(All of it, all of it, all of it)  
He wanted all of it, not some of it

Without a home without a friend without a face to say hello to  
And now the night is near  
Now I can make believe he's here  
  
Sometimes I walk alone at night  
When everybody else is sleeping  
I think of him and then I'm happy  
With the company I'm keeping  
The city goes to bed  
And I can live inside my head  
  
On my own  
Pretending he's beside me  
All alone  
I walk with him 'til morning  
Without him  
I feel his arms around me  
And when I lose my way I close my eyes  
And he has found me  
  
In the rain the pavement shines like silver  
All the lights are misty in the river  
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight  
And all I see is him and me forever and forever  
  
And I know it's only in my mind  
That I'm talking to myself and not to him  
And although I know that he is blind  
Still I say, there's a way for us  
  
I love him  
But when the night is over  
He is gone  
The river's just a river  
Without him  
The world around me changes  
The trees are bare and everywhere  
The streets are full of strangers  
  
I love him  
But every day I'm learning  
All my life  
I've only been pretending  
Without me  
His world would go on turning  
A world that's full of happiness  
That I have never known

When you give life  
Then you become  
What you are

We're all drifting away  
Away from you  
But I pray for you now  
Hoping to god on high  
Is like clinging to straws  
While drowning oh

Is a best in a lover's arms  
What you are  
Is the devil in a sweet sweet kiss  
What you are

I'm sure they shivered when they finally touched the ground.  
And the giant leap so fragile that it hardly made a sound...

Now the story's told that Adam jumped,  
But I've been thinking that he fell  
  
Together we went traveling,  
As we received the call  
His destination India,  
And I had none at all

With our backs against the wall  
So free of fear, we never thought

As our goodbyes were said  
And I never heard from him again  
As each our lives we led  
Except for once in someone else's  
Letter that I read  
Until I heard the sudden word  
That a friend of mine was dead  
  
I sit before my only candle,  
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way

And when I stood myself beside him,  
I never though I was as strong  
Still it seems he stopped his singing  
In the middle of his song  
Well I'm not the one to say I know,  
But I'm hoping he was wrong

The marriage spent  
Yeah the widowhood  
Of every government  
Signs for all to see.  
  
I can't run no more  
With that lawless crowd  
While the killers in high places  
Say their prayers out loud.  
But they've summoned, they've summoned up  
A thundercloud  
And they're going to hear from me.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
  
You can add up the parts  
But you won't have the sum  
You can strike up the march,  
There is no drum  
Every heart, every heart  
To love will come  
But like a refugee.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack, a crack in everything  
That's how the light gets in.

green knoll, outside of town by  
the train tracks and a seagull dump  
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel  
and her 'Marvellous Pigs In Satin'  
  
We pounded our stakes in the ground  
All powder brown  
And the branches spread like scary  
fingers reaching  
We were in a pasture outside Kankakee  
  
And One Eyed Myra, the queen of  
the galley who trained the  
ostrich and the camels  
She looked at me squinty with her  
one good eye in a Roy Orbison  
T-shirt as she bottle fed  
an orangutan named Tripod  
  
And then there was  
Yodeling Elaine the  
queen of the air who wore a  
dollar sign medallion and she  
had a tiny bubble of spittle  
around her nostril and a  
little rusty tear, for she had  
lassoed and lost another  
tipsy sailor  
  
And over in  
the burnt yellow tent  
by the frozen tractor, the  
music was like electric sugar  
And Zuzu Bolin played  
'Stavin' Chain' and Mighty  
Tiny on the saw and he  
threw his head back with a  
mouth full of gold teeth  
And they played 'Lopsided heart'  
And 'Moon over Dog Street'  
  
And by the time they played 'Moanin Low'  
I was soakin' wet and wild eyed  
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a  
preparation and I fell asleep with  
'Livery Stable Blues' in my ear  
  
And me and Molley Hoey drank  
Pruno and Koolaid and she had a  
tattoo gun made out of a cassette  
motor and a guitar string and  
she soaked a hanky in 3 Roses  
and rubbed it on the spot  
and drew a rickety heart and  
a bent arrow and it hurt like hell  
  
And Funeral Wells spun  
Poodle Murphy on the target  
as he threw his hardware,  
Only once in Sheboygan did he miss  
at a matinee on Diamond Pier and  
she'd never let him forget it  
  
They were doing two shows and she  
had a high fever and he took  
off a piece of her ear and  
Tip Little told her she should  
leave the bum  
but Poodle said, ""He fetched me  
last time I run.""  
But I'd like to hammer this ring into a bullet  
And I wish I had some whiskey and a gun

Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,  
Defeated, I concede and  
Move closer  
I may find comfort here  
I may find peace within the emptiness  
How pitiful  
  
It's calling me  
  
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping  
The moon tells me a secret, my confidant  
As full and bright as I am  
This light is not my own and  
A million light reflections pass over me  
  
Its source is bright and endless  
She resuscitates the hopeless  
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting  
  
And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt  
Don't want to be down here feeding my narcissism.  
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late  
I pray the light lifts me out  
Before I pine away.  
  
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late  
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,  
And you will come to find that we are all one mind  
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.  
Just let the light touch you  
And let the words spill through  
And let them pass right through  
Bringing out our hope and reason  
Before we pine away.

There's a tree where the doves go to die  
There's a piece that was torn from the morning,  
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws  
I want you, I want you, I want you  
On a chair with a dead magazine  
In the cave at the tip of the lilly,  
In some hallway where love's never been  
On a bed where the moon has been sweating,  
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
There's a concert hall in Vienna  
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews  
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking  
They've been sentenced to death by the blues  
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture  
With a garland of freshly cut tears?  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years  
  
There's an attic where children are playing,  
Where I've got to lie down with you soon,  
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns,  
In the mist of some sweet afternoon  
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow,  
All your sheep and your lillies of snow  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
And I'll dance with you in Vienna  
I'll be wearing a river's disguise  
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,  
My mouth on the dew of your thighs  
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,  
With the photographs there, and the moss  
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty  
My cheap violin and my cross  
And you'll carry me down on your dancing  
To the pools that you lift on your wrist  
O my love, o my love  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
It's yours now. It's all that there is

Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility  
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free  
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

And little is new  
And as the sunrise stream  
Flickers on me,  
My friends talk  
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word  
  
""We had a friend, a talking man  
Who spoke of many powers that he had  
Not of the best of men, but ours  
  
We used him  
We let him use his powers  
We let him fill our needs  
Now we are strong  
  
And the road is coming to its end  
Now the damned have no time to make amends  
No purse of token fortune stands in our way  
The silent guns of love  
Will blast the sky  
We broke the ruptured structure built of age  
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  
  
Where money stood  
We planted seeds of rebirth  
And stabbed the backs of fathers  
Sons of dirt  
  
Infiltrated business cesspools  
Hating through our sleeves  
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat  
Stoned the poor  
On slogans such as  
  
'Wish You Could Hear'  
'Love Is All We Need'  
'Kick Out The Jams'  
'Kick Out Your Mother'  
'Cut Up Your Friend'  
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'  
  
And we know the flag of love is from above  
And we can force you to be free  
And we can force you to believe""  
  
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain  
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain  
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain  
It said:  
""I believe in the power of good  
I believe in the state of love  
I will fight for the right to be right  
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""  
  
And I open my eyes to look around  
And I see a child laid slain  
On the ground  
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command  
But not hearing anymore  
Not hearing anymore  
Just the shrieks from the old rich  
  
And I want to believe  
In the madness that calls 'Now'  
And I want to believe  
That a light's shining through  
Somehow  
  
And I want to believe  
And you want to believe  
And we want to believe  
And we want to live  
Oh, we want to live  
  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live

And there's no going back  
The loneliness calls him  
And the edge which must be sharpened  
He's losing it. And he knows.  
But there's a fighter in his mind and his body's tough  
The years have been unkind but kind enough  
  
The smell of the earth  
It's his favourite smell  
But he's somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell  
To the place where he hurts and he's scared  
And there's no one to tell  
And no one who doesn't listen  
  
""You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
And I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud

""Only me and the sea  
We will do as we please.""  
  
He remembers the day he was marched to the front  
By the physical knuckle head teacher of games  
""Look lads"" he declared, ""This boy's a cream puff  
No guts and no muscles  
No spine and no stuffing""  
The whole schoolroom sniggered  
And silently thanked God it wasn't them..  
  
But time is revenge. All the bullies grow weak  
And must live with faithless women who despise them  
I'll be in Barbados in a couple of weeks  
With a rum on the table and yarns by the yard  
A story to tell and a story to save  
..unless she changes her mind  
I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen to much of life so the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my boat tonight  
  
The wind changed  
I felt it run beneath my ear  
Like silk drawn across my neck  
A dream of your legs  
Defying gravity in love  
  
The medium wave  
Brought signals here from far away  
Your tender voice riding on the sea spray  
Something in the air  
For those who know the signs  
Something in the air  
A storm..  
  
When I was alive  
When I was alive  
Don't wanna remember  
When I was alive  
  
Watch me watch me  
Paint this picture  
Stretchin Hurtin Cursin  
Watch me  
Takin it Takin it Takin it Takin it....  
Watch me. Watch me. God above..  
  
Between two planets  
In between the points of light  
Between two distant shorelines  
Here am I  
  
Between two planets  
In the black daylight of space  
Between two heavenly bodies  
The invisible man.  
Ripping out the radio  
I want to be alone

I seen nights full of pain, days are the same  
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain  
I search but never find, hurt but never cry  
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind  
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond  
The top gets higher the more that I climb  
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger  
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga  
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'  
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'

Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof  
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off  
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off  
Huh, my word is my pride  
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise  
Served to survive, murdered and bribed  
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

This pain you'll never know  
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold  
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall  
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""Fuck 'em all""  
  
Man, it feels like these walls are closing in  
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then  
Your days are numbered like pages in  
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy  
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all  
Shook and scared to look in my eyes  
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I  
Came up from behind  
And pretty much snuck up  
And butt-fucked this game up  
Better be careful when you bring my name up  
Fuck this fame, that ain't what  
I came to claim but the game  
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it  
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it  
I swear to God, won't spare the rod  
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod  
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!  
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie  
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye  
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die  
My head is swole, my confidence is up  
This stage is my pedestal  
I'm unstoppable, incredible  
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball  
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg  
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce and olives  
I'll fuckin'  
  
Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head

She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone.

But I belong in the front singing loud  
And I'll go solo, hey  
But the fame is a hell of a temptress  
Not my wife but I guess she's a mistress, oh  
Can I let her go  
  
She can play tricks on your mind  
Have you leave your soul behind  
She's turned some niggas out  
But she can't keep her spell on me  
She can't keep back mailing me

Open a book  
Take a look at the way things stand.

To the place by the sea.

A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer  
And the judges watched us from the other side

Preserve my room but do not shed a tear  
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you  
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""  
  
But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever  
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame  
She said at last I was her finest lover  
And if she withered I would be to blame  
  
The judges said you missed it by a fraction  
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack  
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action  
Oh see the men of action falling back  
  
But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment  
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still  
My falsity had stung me like a hornet  
The poison sank and it paralyzed my will  
  
I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers  
That they had been deserted from above  
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona  
I'm listed with the enemies of love  
  
And long ago she said ""I must be leaving,  
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon  
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping  
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""  
  
So daily I renew my idle duty  
I touch her here and there, I know my place  
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty  
And people call me traitor to my face

And baby, you're just movin' on  
And I'll still love you even if I can't  
See you anymore  
Can't wait to see you soar

When Esther first saw the Armenian man  
Who groveled toward her and stood by her side  
With a bucket that swung in his hand  
  
His grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks  
And his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb  
And the lights from the rides showed a mischievous sparkle  
That flashed in his hollow eyed stare  
  
He said ""Little girl, you can chop off my legs  
And then peel off my socks if you want to.  
But I'd rather you took this old puppet from me  
That I hold in my pail as we speak.""  
  
And he stood looking down at the innocent girl  
And she stared at the bucket bewildered  
Til he lifted the doll for the young girl to see  
And a giant smile grew on his face  
She saw the doll's eyes and she couldn't resist  
And she thanked the man quickly and ran to the church  
And she burst through the door with puppet held high  
And a hush filled the chapel, and the people looked mean  
  
Esther tried in vain to pacify the mob  
Quibble grew to spat, to wrangle, then to brawl  
The frenzied congregation struggled desperately to fetch  
The pretty puppet snugly nestled deep in Esther's leather sack  
Through the window of the church a storm began to rage  
And Esther knew the time had come to flee  
  
She scurried down the aisle toward the doorway in the distance  
And out into the rainstorm where she felt she would be free  
But the wind was blowing harder  
And her skirt began to billow  
Until finally her feet began to lift  
  
And she rose above the people and the houses  
and the chimneys  
And Esther and the doll were set adrift  
Floating higher over the hills, and the valleys and treetops  
they'd flutter and glide  
Soaring and turning suspended on air  
With the earth far below them they'd tumble  
And dive through the clouds  
  
And she began to plummet earthward till she  
Landed in the nasty part of town  
  
She glanced about the village sure to find the evil men  
Who rob and pillage in the darkest hour of night  
Nervously she fumbled for the pouch that held the  
Puppet on her rump.  
  
Feeling quite outnumbered Esther hid behind  
A nearby pile of lumber, where she waited  
Till the dawn  
Cause it would have been a blunder to  
Succumb to a hoodlum on the prowl  
  
When the morning came, she wandered through the streets  
Along the chilly lake that lay beside the town  
At last a peaceful moment, but she thought she heard a sound  
It was an angry mob of joggers coming up to knock her down  
  
As Esther stood and shook her head  
The joggers were approaching  
And she knew she had no choice left but to swim  
As the frosty water sank its bitter teeth into her hide  
She tried to slide the heavy clothing from her skin  
  
Naked now she made her way toward the shore  
When suddenly she felt a tiny tugging at her toe.  
And the puppet she'd forgotten wrapped its tiny  
Little arms around her ankle and wouldn't let her go.  
  
The waves seemed to open and swallow her whole  
As the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep  
And the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears  
As she drifted away to a tranquil  
And motionless sleep.

There's a wire in my jacket. This is my trade  
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid  
I can hot wire an ignition like some kind of star  
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car  
So I whisper to the engine, flick on the lights  
And we drive into the night  
  
Oh the smell of the leather always excited my imagination  
And I picture myself in this different situation  
I'm a company director, two kids and a wife  
I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life  
There's some kind of complication, he tells her he's alone  
Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne  
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near  
Start ringing in my ear  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could its, what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid form the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight  
  
I imagine his wife, she don't look nothing like a fool  
She picks the kids up form some private school  
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone  
But there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne  
And the kid's just won't be quiet and she runs a traffic light  
And she drives into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light

And I rode along side

And I rode along side  
Till the honey spread  
Itself so thin

For me to take your word

Looking for some Indian blood and  
Find a little in you find a little  
In me we may be  
On this road but  
We're just  
Impostors  
In this country you know  
So we go along and we said  
We'd fake it  
Feel better with  
Oliver Stone  
Till I  
Almost smacked him  
Seemed right that night and  
I don't know what  
Takes hold  
Out there in the  
Desert cold  
These guys think they must  
Try and just get over on us  
  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
And I was ridin' by  
Ridin' along side  
For a while till you lost me  
And I was ridin' by  
Ridin' along till you lost me  
Till you lost  
Me in  
The rear  
View  
You lost me  
I said  
Way up North I took my day  
All in all was a pretty nice  
Day and I put the hood  
Right back where  
You could taste heaven  
Perfectly  
Feel out the summer breeze  
Didn't know when we'd be back  
And I I don't  
Didn't think  
We'd end up like  
Like this

Expect to improve  
It's gonna take a lot more  
Than tryin' to remove  
The other race  
Or the other whatever  
From the face  
Of the planet altogether  
They call it the earth  
Which is a dumb kinda name  
But they named it right

Makes the details  
Sound real gory  
'bout what to do

Don't believe in the book

Without no feet  
'n pretty soon

For dummies to jog on  
Or doggies to dog on  
Religious fanatics  
Can make it be all gone  
(I mean it won't blow up  
'n disappear  
It'll just look ugly  
For a thousand years...)  
You can't run a country  
By a book of religion  
Not by a heap  
Or a lump or a smidgeon  
Of foolish rules  
Of ancient date  
Designed to make  
You all feel great  
While you fold, spindle  
And mutilate  
Those unbelievers  
From a neighboring state  
To arms! to arms!  
Hooray! that's great  
Two legs ain't bad  
Unless there's a crate  
They ship the parts  
To mama in  
For souvenirs: two ears (get down!)  
Not his, not hers, (but what the hey? )  
The good book says:  
(""it gotta be that way!"")  
But their book says:  
""revenge the crusades...  
With whips 'n chains  
'n hand grenades...""  
Two arms? two arms?  
Have another and another  
Our God says:  
""there ain't no other!""  
Our God says  
""it's all okay!""  
Our God says  
""this is the way!""  
It says in the book:  
""burn 'n destroy...  
'n repent, 'n redeem  
'n revenge, 'n deploy  
'n rumble thee forth  
To the land of the unbelieving scum on the other side  
'cause they don't go for what's in the book  
'n that makes 'em bad  
So verily we must choppeth them up  
And stompeth them down  
Or rent a nice french bomb  
To poof them out of existence  
While leaving their real estate just where we need it  
To use again  
For temples in which to praise our god  
(""cause he can really take care of business!"")  
And when his humble tv servant  
With humble white hair  
And humble glasses  
And a nice brown suit  
And maybe a blond wife who takes phone calls  
Tells us our God says  
It's okay to do this stuff  
Then we gotta do it,  
'cause if we don't do it,  
We ain't gwine up to hebbin!  
(depending on which book you're using at the  
Time...can't use theirs... it don't work  
...it's all lies...gotta use mine...)  
Ain't that right?  
That's what they say  
Every night...  
Every day...  
Hey, we can't really be dumb  
If we're just following god's orders  
Hey, let's get serious...  
God knows what he's doin'  
He wrote this book here  
An' the book says:  
He made us all to be just like him,""  
So...  
If we're dumb...  
Then God is dumb...

Are you scared to death to live?  
I been running all my life  
Just to find a home that's for the restless  
And the truth that's in the message  
Making my way, away, away  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm still breathing  
Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way, my way  
Cause I'm still breathing  
Cause I'm still breathing on my own  
My head's above the rain and roses  
Making my way, my way, my way...  
Cause I'm still breathing  
Cause I'm still breathing on my own

Making my way, my way

Things can go bump, in the dead of the night

Safaris to the heart of all that jazz  
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes  
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights  
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews  
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine  
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue  
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line  
  
In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer  
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear  
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive  
They'll eat a working girl like her alive  
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand  
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines  
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band  
He hangs it up above the jungle line  
  
The jungle line, the jungle line  
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time  
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind  
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in  
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke  
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine  
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats  
Charging, chanting down the jungle line  
  
There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb  
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room  
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet  
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit  
And metal skin and ivory birds  
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines  
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge  
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line

My horse was getting tired, and so was I  
Up there the moon was full, down here darkness ruled  
The trees were so much higher than they were meant to  
  
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""  
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes  
I used to know this road so well, many a time i was here before  
  
But now it seemed so different, the road was no more  
I was lost, I stopped and looked around  
I had this eerie feeling, that I was being watched  
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""  
  
I knew I was not alone, and it wasn't not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes  
Watching me  
The trees have eyes, watching me  
  
Then the sound I didn't want to hear, howling at the moon  
Eyes I didn't want to see, I should have turned around  
So much louder, the howling was chilling my bones  
One wolf grown to a dozen, and here I was alone  
  
Yellow eyes, they were everywhere, yellow eyes, as I prepared to die  
Suddenly there she was, in a halo of light  
Suddenly there she was, silvery black and white  
The bluest magical eyes staring right into mine  
  
Never ever had I seen in a wolf, such a beautiful beast  
In what is known as ""The Devil's Hide""  
I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no, I could feel the trees have eyes

Secure them in their dreamland

And the nightmares can't be found  
And in their place there seems to be  
Good feeling all around  
  
Instead of screams, I swear  
I can hear music in the air  
The smell of cakes and pies  
Are absolutely everywhere  
  
The sights, the sounds  
They're everywhere and all around  
I've never felt this good before  
This empty place inside of me has been filling up  
I simply cannot get enough  
  
I want it, oh, I want it  
Oh, I want it for my own

I've got to know

A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been  
Hanging on the arm of someone else  
I'm still in love with you  
Won't you come back to your little boy blue  
I've come to feel inside  
This precious love was never mine

That I could not live without you  
In the dark or the broad daylight

When it took so long to save me  
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea

I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?

Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees,  
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold

On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay  
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away

Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love  
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear  
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves  
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride  
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold

But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)

Walking on the beach our toes in the sand  
I can see us on the country side  
Sitting in the grass laying side by side

And made you smile with every word I wrote (What would you do)  
Would that make you wanna change your scene  
And wanna be the one on my team (Tell me would you)

It's time to get it JT  
I don't what she hesitatin' for man  
  
Shorty, cool as a fan on the move once again  
But he still has fam from Peru to Japan  
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan  
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can  
Cause the girls really wild, throw they hands up high  
When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy  
You don't really wanna let the chance go by  
Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly  
Friends so fly I can go fly private, cause I handle mine  
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply cause I am on fire  
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny  
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die  
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?  
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie  
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high  
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy  
Ain't gonna lie, I feel your space  
But forget your face, I swear I will  
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill  
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

A leader in the rapture of his absolute right will not connect with a young
man wrapped in the flag, in a black bag.  
  
Voice raised in a room of silence, conquers fear, takes action, starts the
journey, starts the journey  
  
Baby born with an open mind and a trusting face has no regard for distinction,
says to have hope is to be human  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day

There's a party getting started in the yard  
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive  
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?  
  
By the pool last night, apparently  
The chemicals weren't mixed properly  
You hit your head and then forgot your name  
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain  
And now your altitude and memory's a shame

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up  
With a little bit more of innocence  
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young  
It's OK to be easily ignored

And when the house was left in shambles  
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass  
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around  
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce  
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes  
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age  
and they never check to see my grades

Listening to my boot heels click  
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette  
When I turned the corner

Let the informa call 911  
And when security police force want to arrive  
Don't try to run, don't try to hide  
Just pull out the nine, pop in the clip  
And let one slip into these crazy fools

I am your host  
LL Cool J  
  
You said I was finished  
And Father Time was the blame  
You disrespected my legacy  
And threw dirt on my name  
Told DJs he's over  
He ain't spittin' the same  
What he says is irrelevant  
Hip-Hop culture has changed  
When I walk in the room  
Young boys look at me strange  
As if I am a relic  
From some long forgotten game  
It makes my blood boil  
Turns my eyes to flames  
I built an empire  
They tried to kick me out in the rain  
So I called on an inner power  
It's hard to explain  
It's like a holy spirit  
Utilizing hip hop slang  
I'm beyond the gold grills  
And logos on chains  
You see I changed rap forever  
I elevated the game  
Launched the greatest label  
In the history of rap  
And for twenty four years  
I carried it on my back  
I've always shined brighter  
When I'm under attack  
I might be down for a moment  
But I always come back  
  
[Chorus]  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Check it)  
It's time for war  
  
This is a resurrection  
I'm back from the dead  
They told me quit a long time ago  
But I conquered instead  
I had dreams and visions  
Swirling around in my head  
I had this hunger deep inside of me  
That has to be fed  
Hip hop will respect  
All the blood that I shed  
I have a covenant with God  
I have swallowed the bread  
Hip hop my co-defendant  
With this mic I thee wed  
I made an entire generation  
Obey what we said  
I'm talkin' France to Germany  
From Italy to Japan  
From London to Belgium  
To Afghanistan  
From Farmers Boulevard  
Smokin' a blunt with my man  
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board  
To build Def Jam  
You see, I'm the undisputed  
King of all hip hop  
Everything after is my legacy  
Like it or not  
And I will keep making history  
I can't stop  
LL Cool J  
Eternally hot  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how easily I flipped it  
And switched the style around  
Competition losin' their footing  
I see them falling down  
They will plot against me  
It kills them because I'm ballin' now  
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone  
But I got you callin' now  
This is a job that must get done  
Even if I become public enemy number one  
If I had to pick up an Uzi  
That weighs over a ton  
I will attack hip hop  
Until competition is none  
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L  
You end up tortured  
And trapped in psychological hell  
And this is the beginning  
Of a new era in rap  
LL Cool J, feel the impact  
It's okay if you call it a comeback  
And let them know  
I'm ready for combat  
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back  
The crown looks wrong on your head  
I want that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time for war  
  
It's time for war

For I know not what I've done.  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,  
I just never had the chance to ever meet You,  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,  
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Mama had a baby and its head popped off  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)

But mama don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off  
(getting dropped off)  
(getting dropped off)  
(getting dropped off)

porch  
(Their front porch)  
(Their front porch)  
(Their front porch)  
(Their front porch)  
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn  
(Else's lawn)  
(Else's lawn)  
(Else's lawn)  
Til' someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles  
(Edna and Charles)  
(Edna and Charles)  
(Edna and Charles)  
They were the ones who were left in charge  
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song  
(Sing this song)  
(Sing this song)  
(Sing this song)  
It went a little something like  
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,  
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn  
Mama why do they keep saying this I just don't understand understand  
And by the way where's my dad?!  
  
[Chorus]  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet you  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately  
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?  
Where does that leave me?  
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'  
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream  
While I'm projectile vomiting.  
What do I look like a Comedian to you?  
Do you think that I?m kidding?  
What do I look like some kinda idiot?  
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood?  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish  
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had,  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his ex-wife how they go at it man  
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers  
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it,  
Shit if you only knew the half of it?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds  
Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?  
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.  
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere  
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round  
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just don't close for me  
This ain't how fame was supposed to be  
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ooh!  
Last one baby  
Lets Go  
Detroit!

Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
There'll be no one else  
That you'll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
I'm gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed 'em all off  
And they sent 'em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
You're coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court

But He Himself was broken, long before the sky would open  
Forsaken, almost human, He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with him,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you think maybe you'll trust him,  
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.  
  
Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river,  
She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,  
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour,  
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers,  
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning,  
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever,  
While Suzanne holds the mirror.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that you can trust her,  
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

Knowing that fate is cruel,  
You ought to forget it.  
Yes, I know it's true,  
I've seen what love can do,  
But I don't regret it.  
Oh, you silly thing  
Don't you see what's happening?  
You're better without it.  
  
No, that's not the case  
If you were in my place,  
You never would doubt it.  
  
Sentimental fool  
Who broke the golden rule,  
You couldn't resist it.  
Though it's all in vain,  
I'd do it all again  
Just to relive a minute.  
A woman in love  
Can make you feel good  
  
You know what you're living for.  
She'll give you so much  
And keep you in touch  
With all that's worth living for.  
Oh once she gets in  
Through thick and through thin  
She'll show you what living's for.  
  
The rhythm of love  
It must go on  
Can't stop.  
The beat of your heart  
Is like a drum  
Will it stop?

Here's the famous Robbin Hood of the old west.  
  
Cisco, the sheriff, he's getting closer!  
  
This way Poncho, vominos. The Cisco Kid.  
  
Way, way, way, we way back in the days the year, 1980.  
Had to get a job, had to make some money-ney  
Picked up a pen and a pad,  
Dropped reality never thinking that I would live to see the day I'd rock my
own CD  
  
We used to do the dance we called obie-obie  
Now S.T.P. 1993, so Hollywood get out my way  
My mom's words seems like yesterday  
""Love Jesus, don't forget to pray""  
She most have gone with the boss D.J. Right?  
(Don't be too sure of that fat one. Fat one?)  
And feelin though, skinny coming with the 9mm  
  
Cause he who has the money has the authority,  
And respect to the man with the Uzi  
(I'm pretty handy with a six gun myself)  
The 808 kick is on my hit list  
And this beat's cooking like an Ital Dish  
It wasn't hard for me to do, it so easy  
Because to me loops loops tight go naturally  
Mom's words seem like yesterday.  
  
What's your name? Cisco Kid.  
Si, Poncho's name is, Poncho.  
  
Now in '94 we got an S.T.P.  
A half pack of smokes, and oh yes, and Sammy  
A fifteen pack of Old Milwaukee  
A dalmatian and a girlfriend,  
But I ain't got no money-ne-ne-ne  
  
The 808 is within my reach,  
Sublime beats are comin' straight from long beach.  
If you think that Hollywood  
Didn't get what he deserved,  
Call 808 kit to get served  
  
(Scarface)  
How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy, man?  
  
There's always some hombre that can't resist swapin' lead,  
Just to see if their faster with the six gun than Cisco is.  
  
They'll only find out Cisco is fastet.  
  
Well that don't stop 'em from tryin' Poncho,  
Like Slade here,  
He fancies himself as fast on the draw as a quarter-horse  
Takin' after a stray.  
  
What's the matter? Can't the Cisco Kid talk for himself?  
Is that how you got your reputation Cisco,  
By havin' your partner build you up?  
  
I make no claim to a reputation senor,  
And no one has to talk for me.  
  
The Cisco Kid, heh,.  
The kid part fits you from the way you act.  
  
I've meet with your kind before.  
You a foolish hombre if you think he will not fight you.  
  
Your making big talk for an hombre who will not fight.  
  
You are wrong Slade,  
I'll fight you any place, any time.  
If there is a good reason.  
  
Well here's a fist full of reasons!  
  
Now you two quit that.  
  
Just as soon as I finish off this Cisco Kid.  
  
You are the one that is finished you faggot.  
  
Is that a good punch?  
  
Alright you two, that's enough,  
Let him alone Cisco.  
  
I won't forget this Cisco,  
I'll take this up with you another time.  
  
Any time hombre,  
I'd be glad to accommodate you.  
  
I'll make it soon Cisco.  
  
Shit up cash, keep your mouth shut.  
  
That's what I mean, Cisco,  
You attract trouble like a fiddler attracts a square dance,  
You understand why I don't want  
You staying in this town?  
  
Do not worry sheriff

Never had a friend  
Never laughed or cried much

No soft touch

Gotta make that money  
Make that money, listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
Now that I'm a man  
Every penny has been planned  
I'm financially grand  
And perfectly greedy  
Sentimental fools  
I make all your rules  
I've got your cash, got your jewels  
They're all mortgaged to me

'Cause he told me so  
Told me so I believe him  
I still believe...  
Give me that money  
  
Controlling all your cash  
I could make you live in trash  
I eat pheasant, you eat hash  
No philanthropy  
But when it's time for me to croak  
Bury me with all my dough  
And where there should've been an oak  
My private money tree will grow  
  
Make that money  
Said make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
  
Told me so  
Told me so  
He told me so

I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying  
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear  
I never heard such profanity  
  
I dropped my suit on the floor  
they were trying to block the door  
They were calling her a whore  
They were driven to nativities insanity  
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze

She wasn't lookin' to become my wife  
She said, ""I hope you understand  
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny""  
  
She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin  
Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities  
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes  
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality  
  
She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me  
It's warmer here by the fire""  
She didn't know that there was more of me  
She'd have to learn to love all four of me  
  
Cause I'm in no man's land  
I'm lookin' for the real me, If only I could feel me  
You know I'm in no man's land

Dipped in wine

The night air now restless and dank  
Yet the fields are specked with flowers  
Few and rank  
  
Moon reflecting off the water  
Rippling an image to me  
Of the way that it is  
And the way that it's going to be

Everything turns to shit  
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear  
Peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,  
You've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars  
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear  
Pray your life was just a dream  
The cut that never heals  
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream  
The world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream  
There's no one left for you

There?s nothing, I wouldn?t give  
For one more time, when I can sing for you

Oh Yeah

Soft and low when the evening comes  
Holding you, sleeping in my arms  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to sing for you

Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page.

Inside I must continue.

Jutting around round round  
Round like a broken speeding statue.

And the Greeks too are finished.  
The face of Alexander remains not only solely  
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight  
And magnetism of Alexander himself.

He must he must he must be intoxicated  
By ritual as well as result.

Of the bouncer. and I trust my guitar.

Therefore I would run through scum.

We're ascending through the hollow mountain.  
We are peeking.

And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken  
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers  
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers  
  
There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour  
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower  
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him  
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer  
  
There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door  
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more  
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor  
And you're torn if you should leave him with a number  
  
And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away  
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say  
And you tell him that you're never coming home  
  
She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculation's
right  
And there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night  
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day  
She'll take a job she'll find a friend she'll make a life that's better  
  
The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella  
And there's nothing they can do for her, there's nothing they can tell her  
There's nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today  
She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her  
  
Now in her imagination she's a million miles away  
When too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head  
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie  
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know  
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better  
  
I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor  
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face  
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late  
I'm almost done and then I see the letter  
  
In his imagination she's a universe away  
Too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I'm gonna live my life  
And she told him she was never coming home  
I'm gonna live my life in my own way

In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland

Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you  
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you  
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it

[Verse 2]  
I always hear, always hear them talking  
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with money  
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it  
You didn't love me, no, not really  
Wait  
I could have really liked you  
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you  
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good  
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused

Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?  
Do you care what is thought by others about you?  
If this day is all that is promised to you  
Do you life for the future the present the past?

Oh thought I might drown but its hard to be givin'.  
Downtown's where's you'll find me do some and got a hand.  
Although I never listen girl, I damn well understand.  
And you think, I'm so damn feeble.  
I can't see through your lies, you're just a crock of shit,  
With a pretty smile, and I refuse to compromise.  
  
Oh, don't give me such a heavy, heavy, heavy load  
  
You may hold some vision of truth, if truth can found in a lie.  
Maybe some grain of inspiration, for song that's deep inside.  
  
Oh, tears running down your face,  
Just screaming look me in the eye.  
Well I'm licking straight at your twisted face,  
And it's enough to make me cry.  
  
Oh, I payed the price of loving you,  
In more ways than one.  
Wrapped around your finger but I think my time has come,  
But I never can be too sure 'cause I like to have a little fun.  
  
Oh, what fun it would be to blow my mind and fall into the sun.  
A mind is a precious thing to taste.

who always wanted me out of your sight  
I would come walkin' in and I'd say hello but you'd slap me  
And you'd make some fucked up comment about my clothes, but I tried to let it
pass  
But the pictures in my head were with you with a knife up your ass  
Laying dead, so I popped some more caps in your ass now your son is not so fun

Lying by the swimming pool  
Life is so cool  
Easy living when you make the rules

It only took about a half a minute  
On the stairway  
It was child's play

Is what you get for messing with the steel claw  
  
The politicians have forgotten this place  
Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes  
No election  
They cross the line  
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime  
If they could see what's going on around here  
So many people hanging onto the edge  
Crying out for revolution  
Retribution

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy  
Sometimes I do a line, makes me laugh  
Makes me want to take a joyride  
On the high tide  
Sometimes I'm contemplating suicide  
Meanwhile Eddy is on the west coast  
I know he's making out with some sweet senorita  
Up in Frisco  
You and I know  
The odds turn out even

He comes from a foreign place  
An island far away  
Intrigues me with every move  
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless  
Can't keep my cool  
Steals my heart when he takes my hand  
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band  
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips  
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss  
  
Mama used to warn me  
To beware of those Latin lovers  
She said I gave my heart too soon  
And that's how I became your mother  
I said hey mama, you seem to forget  
I'm not in love yet  
Sweet talk don't win me over  
But I realized  
Big brown eyes can hypnotize  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
Hey  
  
Skin the color of cinnamon  
His eyes light up and I melt within  
Feels so good it must be a sin  
I can't stop what I started  
I'm giving in  
He brings life to my fantasies  
Sparks a passion inside of me  
Finds the words when I can not speak  
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me  
  
Mama used to warn me  
Not to rush love with another  
She said I'm not trying to lecture  
I just care about my daughter  
Ay mama, you seem to forget  
I never will let  
A man control my emotions  
But when he smiles (when he smiles)  
I feel like a little child  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
  
Caught between my mama's words  
And what I feel inside  
I'm wanting to explore his world  
But a part of me wants to hide  
Should I risk it, can't resist it  
This has caught me by surprise  
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico  
I can't hold back no more  
Let's go tonight  
Ooh, hey  
  
You adore me, never be lonely, oh  
  
I am full blood boricua (boricua)  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (on his arm)  
He tells me, mami I need ya

I can't help, what I'm feeling  
Infatuated  
Oh oh, oh

A veil of stars, watching  
My shadow is born from light  
The light of the eye, in darkness  
  
Over troubled waters memories soar  
Endlessly, searching night and day  
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill  
With the calmness of a whisper  
  
I wear a naked soul  
A blank face in the streaming water  
It is cold in here  
Frost scar my coat with dust  
  
Eyes attach to your mute portrait  
We spoke only through thoughts  
Together we gazed, awaited  
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun  
  
Sun birds leave their dark recesses  
Shadows gild the archways  
  
Do not turn your face towards me  
Confronting me with my loneliness  
You are in a forest unknown  
The secret orchard  
And your voice is vast and achromatic  
But still so precious  
  
Lullaby of the crescent moon took you  
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face  
Granted you a hollow stare  
Another soul within the divine herd  
  
I have kept it  
The amaranth symbol  
Hidden inside the golden shrine  
Until we rejoice in the meadow  
Of the end  
When we both walk the shadows  
It will set ablaze and vanish  
Black rose immortal  
  
It is getting dark again  
Dusk shuffle across the fields  
The evening trees moan as if they knew  
At night I always dream of you

And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear  
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings  
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings  
You looked so grand wearing wings  
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing  
Can you fly  
I heard you can! Can you fly  
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky  
  
I followed with the sideshows to another town  
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds  
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice  
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice  
  
I heard your bid once or twice  
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price  
Pack it in  
I heard you did! Pack it in  
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win  
  
So lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news  
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues  
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine  
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime  
  
I've lost my fire overtime  
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime  
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired!  
Slowin' down  
And I envy you the valley that you've found  
'Cause I'm midway down the midway

How's life, tell me how's your family?  
I haven't seen them in a while.  
You've been good, busier then ever.  
We small talk, work and the weather  
Your guard is up and I know why.  
  
Because the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind.  
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.  
And I go back to December all the time.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.  
I go back to December all the time.  
  
These days I haven't been sleeping  
Staying up playing back myself leaving,  
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.  
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times  
I watched you laughing from the passenger side  
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.  
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.  
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.  
And I go back to December all the time.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.  
I go back to December all the time  
  
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,  
And how you held me in your arms that September night,  
The first time you ever saw me cry.  
Maybe this is wishful thinking,  
Probably mindless dreaming  
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.  
  
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't  
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.  
  
But this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,  
And I go back to December.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.

Hey yo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in  
Brooklyn  
All this while he let the fiends cook it  
The base heads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up  
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up  
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy  
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady  
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin'  
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens  
Even though her leg was bitten  
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins  
Paleface cop who done popped the desk  
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste  
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block  
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti  
And his black partner, he was scared to speak  
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street  
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks  
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin' his beat  
They call him desk duty, Robocop  
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the  
Block

Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo  
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care  
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor  
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her  
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face  
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her  
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her  
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her  
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid  
Wavin' her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks  
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked  
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five  
Wildest niggas just smilin' cause it look live  
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me ?  
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten  
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin'  
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat  
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about  
Livin' in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store  
The bum holdin' the door, the mugging no one saw  
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw  
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores  
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position  
Transformation from critical to, stable condition  
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical  
Watchin' you like salt-water sharks that's tropical  
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it  
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it  
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin' or a wet up  
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up  
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts  
And for some, another way out, is music and sports  
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot  
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed  
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall  
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all  
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name  
I need somebody to help me out of the flames  
  
All I'm trying to do is just master me  
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat  
But something keeps talking to me consciously  
Responsibly it keeps haunting me  
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya  
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia  
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose  
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse  
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead  
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

When the tears stopped falling  
Now all I do is just call your name  
(When I say lover)  
You walked in and my heart discovered  
That my life would never be the same  
Oh, you are my destiny  
You are my one and only  
You gave back joy to me  
When my whole world was lonely  
Angel in disguise  
With your power of love  
You just hypnotize  
I just love the magic of your spell  
How much joy we'll have together  
Only time will tell  
  
Every day, every night  
Oh, I know it's so right  
When I see your face  
Only time's gonna tell  
But I know you so well  
Girl, my love's for real  
  
From the first time that I saw you  
I know it was forever  
This mighty love between us  
Will keep us together  
You're the girl God sent from heaven  
I'm so glad I found you  
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever  
I'm so glad to be around you  
You are my destiny  
You are my one and only  
You gave back joy to me  
When my whole world was lonely  
It's alright, it's alright  
Do it again  
It's alright, it's alright  
Don't let this love end  
It's alright, it's alright  
Do it again  
It's alright, it's alright  
Don't let this love end

My special place  
It's a place that you  
Like no one else I know  
Might appreciate  
I don't go there with anyone--but  
You're a special case  
For my special place  
For my secret place  
  
People talk to tell you something  
Or to take up space  
Guess I'm only talking  
To be talking to  
Your pretty face  
I don't talk much to anyone, but  
You're a special case  
For my special place  
My secret place  
  
I was born and raised  
In New York City  
I'm just getting used to Colorado,  
Oh street bravado  
Carry me  
Why did you bring me to  
A place so wild and pretty?  
Are there pigeons in this park,  
Muggers after dark,  
In these golden trees,  
In the secret place?  
  
I'm going to take you to  
My special place  
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger  
Can deface  
I put things back together there  
It all falls right in place,  
In my special space  
My special place  
  
Once I saw a film  
In New York City  
That was shot in Colorado,  
Girl meets desperado  
In the trembling mountain trees  
Out of all of the girls that you see  
In bleachers and cafe windows  
Sitting, flirting with someone  
Looking to have some fun  
Why did you pick me?  
For the secret place

For a compliment or kindness

I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds  
I tried to make out some connection  
We were at a loss for words

I could not see giving up  
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups

And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
And I believe in you and I believe in love  
So we went rolling on down through the years  
Taking time off we could steal  
Until the thief of things unreconciled  
Stuck it's stick into the wheel  
Now we're tumbling in a freefall  
No one's gonna go unscathed  
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf  
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self  
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands  
So just let it go and see where it lands

Straight from a dreamy castle in the air

And tennis on the sun

And made her make-up run  
On our super-lunar honeymoon

And everything was my fault  
She was a gymnast  
Happily swinging on the uneven bars  
Tucked in a somersault

To heal when you're hurting so much  
Couldn't see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I can't escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
  
I don't want to be here alone  
You might say that it's over  
You might say that you don't care  
You might say you don't miss me  
You don't need me  
But I know that you do and I feel that you do  
  
Inside  
Love takes time  
To heal when you're hurting so much  
Couldn't see that I was blind  
To let you go  
I can't escape the pain  
Inside  
Love takes time  
I don't want to be here alone

A knock at your door  
Is it real or is it a dream  
On trembling legs you open the door  
And you scream on Halloween

Where am I now  
Is there anybody out there  
What has happened  
Am I in heaven  
Or is it hell

It's comin' nearer  
It's shining

I'll show you passion and glory  
He Is the snake  
I'll give you power and abundance  
He's the corrupter of man  
  
Save me from the evil one  
Give me strength to carry on

Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip  
I can't believe you're out there flying with somebody else  
  
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye  
I got an invitation but I didn't reply  
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves  
And give him all of my love

Well maybe all of my friends should confront

And why don't the moon look right

I'm living proof that man can change  
I knew what I wanted  
I knew how to get it  
  
It didn't make it happy so I started again  
What I wanted to be was a family man  
But nature had some alternative plans  
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold  
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
  
But every now and then  
Often at night  
A particular feeling would surface in spite  
Of what I told myself and tried to deny  
I kept on asking the question: why?  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
With time and age I had to change  
Cause my behaviour was getting strange  
People on the street caught my eye  
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy  
  
The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge  
Was in retreat and I was on the verge  
Of falling in love or having fun  
Time was running out  
Something had to be done  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
Where was I?  
Laying down the law  
Dancing with others  
Out on the floor  
  
Music and smoke  
What did it mean?  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  
I had what I wanted  
  
Madly in love  
Nothing else mattered  
This was enough  
Questions were answered  
Which used to perplex  
In particular those about the big s.e.x.  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about love  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
Dreaming is easy  
Life is tough  
I got the picture  
The most important thing  
  
Is not to end up bitter  
Cause when you start to feel  
Increasingly forlorner  
Woomph! love comes  
Right around the corner  
  
It may not last  
But here am I  
Once a caterpillar  
Now a butterfly  
It can seem strange  
But when you reminisce  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change

For whatever you've done  
With the keys  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this  
  
It's dark and it's snowing  
Oh my love I must be going  
The river is starting to freeze  
And I'm sick of pretending  
I'm broken from bending  
I've lived too long  
On my knees  
  
And she dances so graceful  
And your heart's hard and hateful  
And she's naked  
But that's just a tease  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love  
And she comes to you  
Light as the breeze  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this  
  
There's blood on every bracelet  
You can see it, you can taste it  
And it's please baby  
Please baby please  
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim  
But don't forget there's still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise  
  
So I knelt there at the delta  
At the alpha and omega  
I knelt there  
Like one who believes  
And like a blessing come from heaven  
For something like a second  
I was cured, and my heart  
Was at ease  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen  
Oh, something like this

Cause we won't  
Although we want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
I know we've got to move somehow  
But I don't want to lose you know  
  
Sometimes it's so easy  
To let a day  
Slip on by  
Without even seeing each other at all  
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I  
And those will be the days you can never recall  
  
And so we embrace again  
Behind the dunes  
This beach is cold  
On winter afternoons  
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun  
I'm warm from the memory of days to come  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
But we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
But now I need the rest of you

Where miracles happen, where truth can be heard

Founded on faith, connecting us all  
A network of love to answer the call  
Yeah, that's where I am from  
The city of hope

A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder

New York is cold, but I like where I'm living  
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.  
  
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert  
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record.  
  
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair  
She said that you gave it to her  
That night that you planned to go clear  
Did you ever go clear?  
  
Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older  
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder  
You'd been to the station to meet every train  
And you came home without Lili Marlene  
  
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life  
And when she came back she was nobody's wife.  
  
Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth  
One more thin gypsy thief  
Well I see Jane's awake  
  
She sends her regards.  
And what can I tell you my brother, my killer  
What can I possibly say?  
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you  
I'm glad you stood in my way.  
  
If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me  
Well your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.  
  
Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes  
I thought it was there for good so I never tried.

A stainless steel razor blade?  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
There's no hot water  
And the cold is running thin.  
Well, what do you expect from  
The kind of places you've been living in?  
  
Don't drink from that cup,  
It's all caked and cracked along the rim.  
That's not the electric light, my friend,  
That is your vision growing dim.  
  
Cover up your face with soap, there,  
Now you're Santa Claus.  
And you've got a gift for anyone  
Who will give you his applause.  
  
I thought you were a racing man,  
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace.  
That's a funeral in the mirror  
And it's stopping at your face.  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Ah wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
Once there was a path  
And a girl with chestnut hair,  
And you passed the summers  
Picking all of the berries that grew there  
There were times she was a woman,  
Oh, there were times she was just a child,  
And you held her in the shadows  
Where the raspberries grow wild.  
  
And you climbed the twilight mountains  
And you sang about the view,  
And everywhere that you wandered  
Love seemed to go along with you.  
That's a hard one to remember,  
Yes it makes you clench your fist.  
  
And then the veins stand out like highways,  
All along your wrist.  
And yes it's come to this,  
It's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
You can still find a job,  
Go out and talk to a friend.  
On the back of every magazine  
There are those coupons you can send.  
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians,  
They can give you back your hope,  
You can find your love with diagrams  
On a plain brown envelope.  
  
But you've used up all your coupons  
Except the one that seems  
To be written on your wrist  
Along with several thousand dreams.  
  
Now Santa Claus comes forward,  
That's a razor in his mit  
And he puts on his dark glasses  
And he shows you where to hit  
And then the cameras pan,  
The stand in stunt man,  
Dress rehearsal rag,  
It's just the dress rehearsal rag,  
You know this dress rehearsal rag,  
It's just a dress rehearsal rag.

Can't God even take a joke? Huh? NO!  
  
So you wanna to back to Egypt  
Where your friends wait for you  
You can throw a big party and tell the whole gang  
Of what they said was all true  
And this Moses acts like a big shot  
Who does he think he is?  
Well it's true that God works lots of miracles  
But Moses thinks they're all his  
  
Oh we're having so much trouble even now  
Why'd he get so mad about that c-c-c-cow (that golded calf)  
Moses seems rather idle  
He just sits around, he just sits around and writes the Bible!  
  
Oh, Moses, put down your pen!  
What? Oh no, manna again?  
  
Oh, manna waffles  
Manna burgers  
Manna bagels  
Fillet of manna  
Manna patty  
BaManna bread!

Is it me you're looking for?  
Because I wonder where you are  
And I wonder what you do  
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?  
Or is someone loving you?  
Tell me how to win your heart

Pushing forward and arching back  
Bring me closer to heart attack  
Say goodbye and just fly away  
When you come back  
I have some things to say  
  
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone  
When you get home  
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go  
So I can show you how I  
  
Dream away everyday  
Try so hard to disregard  
The rhythm of the rain that drops  
And coincides with the beating of my heart  
  
I'll never leave you behind  
Or treat you unkind  
I know you understand  
And with a tear in my eye  
Give me the sweetest goodbye  
That I ever did receive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone  
When you get home  
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go

Daisies to push through the floor,  
And I wish plant life would grow all around me,  
So I won't feel dead anymore.  
So I won't feel dead anymore.  
  
Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet,  
And give me a ghost of a smile,  
Show me your teeth, 'cause you're teddy beneath,  
So just grin and bear it a while.  
Just grin and bear it a while.

Today I'm busting out,  
Of this old haunted house,  
'Cause I'm sick of waiting for,  
All the spider webs to grow all around me,  
'Cause I don't feel dead anymore.  
And I'm not afraid anymore.

We better work it out or else there's gonna be a showdown now  
  
Why do you do what you do to me?  
You got no clue what you do to me  
Try to say but you couldn't see  
What do come don't come easily  
Only need another day  
  
But it comes and it goes and everybody knows  
That I don't like it, no I don't like it  
And when it flows and when it starts to go  
Then I like it, I sure do like it  
I hope the day never comes you throw it all away  
I only need another day  
  
You never listen when I  
You never listen when I say  
I only need another day  
You never listen when I tell you what I tell you  
I'm thinking what I'm thinkin'  
I need a little time to keep the motor tickin' over now

But I ain't letting that bother me

I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""

Waited for something to come along

There's been times I've been stood in the wind and the rain  
Freezing and busted and tricked out of luck  
And I cursed my teachers for all of their reading

She's on the train  
To somewhere up by Fordham Road  
Her reptile brain  
Locked down and ready in combat mode  
  
Some cash, a key  
This guy she has to see  
A doctor friend uptown  
And maybe she gets to me when she comes back down

I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town  
  
And I said  
""Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""  
  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

senatorial contest out here. I'm from Massachusetts, and I feel that we have a
certain right to gloat over the other states because Massachusetts is after
all the only state with three senators. Anyway, here's a salute to your new
junior senator:  
  
Hollywood's often tried to mix  
Show business with politics  
From Helen Gahagan  
To Ronald Reagan?  
But Mr. Murphy is the star  
Who's done the best by far.  
  
Oh, gee, it's great!  
At last we've got a senator who can really sing and dance.  
We can't expect America to win against its foes  
With no one in the Senate who can really tap his toes.  
  
The movies that you've seen  
On your television screen  
Show his legislative talents at a glance.  
Should Americans pick crops? George says ""No,  
'cause no one but a Mexican would stoop so low.""  
And after all, even in Egypt, the pharaohs  
Had to import Hebrew braceros.  
  
Think of all the musicals we have in store.  
Imagine: ""Broadway Melody of Nineteen Eighty-Four.""  
Yes, now that he's a Senator, he's really got the chance  
To give the public a song and dance!

Leatherman  
Died a long time ago, in the 1880s  
Leatherman, Leatherman  
  
Covered with leather but it wasn't tight  
Underneath the moon in the woods at night  
  
Making the rounds, ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Here's what they say:  
  
""Here he comes, he's a man of the land  
He's Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman, Leatherman.""  
  
Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed  
He wasn't known to say much  
But, ""Thanks for the bread.""  
  
So modern day I walk my way, my jacket faded  
Just like a man of leather to whom I may be related  
  
Rolled a cigarette for which he asked for a light  
Appeared to be an animal, yet so polite

Shakes his head, he's Leatherman  
Bake some bread, he's Leatherman  
Shame he's dead  
I saw his bed  
It's all that's left of Leatherman  
Leatherman  
Give me some skin, Leatherman.

To the old Willow tree

Full of beer, full of cries  
In a drunken town fight

By the dawn's early light

Only fish heads and tails  
And he'll show you his teeth

That can haul up the sails  
That can swallow the moon

With his arms open wide  
""Hey, bring me more fish  
Throw it down by my side""

But he's too full to try  
So he stands up and laughs  
And he zips up his fly

Paunches bursting their pants  
Grinding women to porch  
They've forgotten the tune  
That their whiskey voice croaked  
Splitting the night  
With the roar of their jokes  
And they turn and they dance  
And they laugh and they lust  
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts  
And then out of the night  
With their pride in their pants  
And the sluts that they tow  
Underneath the street lamp  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who drinks  
And he drinks and he drinks  
And he drinks once again  
He'll drink to the health  
Of the whores of Amsterdam  
Who've given their bodies  
To a thousand other men  
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue  
Their goodness all gone  
For a few dirty coins  
When he just can't go on  
Throws his nose to the sky  
Aims it up above  
And he pisses like I cry  
On the unfaithful love

Always strong, tried not to cry  
Never felt like I needed any man  
To comfort me in life  
But I'm all made up today  
A veil upon my face  
But no father stands beside me  
To give this bride away  
  
Well, I'm standing in the chapel  
Wearing my white dress  
I have waited for this moment  
With tears of happiness  
Here I leave behind my past  
By taking the chance  
I've finally found the right man  
  
Thoughts racing fast through my mind  
As I'm gazing down the aisle  
That my future will mend the memories  
Torn between father and child  
  
My emotions overload  
'Cause there is no hand to hold  
There's no shoulder here to lean on  
I'm walking all on my own  
  
Here I go  
  
Now I'm standing at four corners  
To have and to hold  
Now, my love, you stand beside me  
To walk life's winding road  
And I owe it all to you  
For taking that chance  
You've shown me there's a right man  
'Cause I never knew the right man  
  
Well, I'm standing in the chapel  
Ready to confess  
That I've waited for this moment  
With tears of happiness  
Now I leave behind my past  
By taking the chance  
Whoa  
  
Well, I'm standing at four corners  
To have and to hold  
Now, my love, you stand beside me  
To walk life's winding road

Will reach out her hand  
She'll know I found the right man

(Organ solo)  
  
You'll see him in your nightmares,  
You'll see him in your dreams  
He'll appear out of nowhere but  
He ain't what he seems  
You'll see him in your head,  
On the tv screen  
And hey buddy, I'm warning  
You to turn it off  
He's a ghost, he's a god,  
He's a man, he's a guru  
You're one microscopic cog  
In his catastrophic plan  
Designed and directed by  
His red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack):  
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake  
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake  
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't  
Getting near much as he will take.  
  
He's a...  
  
He's mumbling words you can't understand  
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.

Beautiful, eloquent  
He went to Spain  
And where he went, she went  
No Joan of Arc  
She was broken discarded  
And that was a long time ago  
Still, no more love songs

Half an hour of sunshine is worth a week of rain  
  
Air is flowing free, it's a little easier to breathe  
This soul unbound, was lost and found  
No reason left to hide, I feel a light inside and it comes from you

And solemnly swear ""I do""

Mutterin' ""Oh no, here we go again""

Now she's three months late  
And it's twenty bucks a plate I spent, oh

To see the side effects  
Of sex and alcohol  
Please bow your heads and join me  
In a prayer for these two  
Who'll be together forever  
'Til they find somebody new  
  
The bride is a flirt and the groom is worse  
As he's putting the ring on her  
He's checkin' out the bridesmaids  
Thinkin' that he might take  
The maid of honor's honor, oh  
  
Welcome dearly beloved  
We are here this afternoon  
To throw rice as these two  
Drive down the road to ruin  
With cans tied to the bumper  
And a draggin' muffler too  
They'll be together forever  
'Til they find somebody new  
  
So raise your glass and join me  
Here's to the bride and groom  
They'll be together forever

Love can't you hear when I call  
Can't you hear a word I say  
A little love is all I ask  
A little feeling when we touch  
Why am I still alone?  
I've got a heart without a home  
A little love is all I ask - and that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings - but I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls and pretty girls go sailing by  
  
Ocean deep - I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
Ocean deep - will I ever find a lover  
Maybe he has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep - ocean deep  
  
I'm so lonely lonely lonely...  
Maybe..

An endless aching need  
I say love it is a flower  
And you it's only seed  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking  
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken  
Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only  
For the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows  
Lies the seed  
That with the sun's love  
In the spring  
Becomes the rose

Which I attempt to reassemble  
To see just who I might have been.

Like phosphorescent desert buttons  
Singing one familiar song  
""So good to see you.  
I've missed you so much.  
So glad it's over.  
I've missed you so much.  
Came out to watch you play.  
Why are you running away?""  
Prying open my third eye.  
So good to see you once again.  
I thought that you were hiding.  
And you thought that I had run away.  
Chasing the tail of dogma.  
I opened my eye and there we were.  
So good to see you once again  
I thought that you were hiding from me.  
And you thought that I had run away.  
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason.  
Prying open my third eye.

I am the wind blowing through your hair  
  
I am the shadow on the moon at night  
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright  
  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!

Tender lumplings everywhere  
Life's no fun without a good scare

In our town of Halloween

Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back  
And scream like a banshee  
Make you jump out of your skin  
This is Halloween, everybody scream  
Wont' ya please make way for a very special guy  
  
Our man jack is King of the Pumpkin patch

Filled with tempests and with distress!  
Tomorrow through the vale, the traveler will pass,  
Recalling all of the glory of the past.  
And in vain he will search for the bloom of my youth,  
And nothing will he find but deep pain and endless sorrow.

Is that why you're knocking on my door?  
The time I've spent, working myself to death  
Thought that's what you wanted  
I thought you needed my help  
To make it good again, to make us strong  
To make you happy, to push you along  
And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb  
I was on my knees, when you knocked me down  
  
The wheels fell off, the bottom dropped out  
The checks all bounced, I came in your mouth  
Your mother came calling but there was no one around  
The trash caught fire when the leaves turned brown  
The vultures were circling when the circus left town  
I left you a note but I wrote it in disappearing ink

You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Don't judge me  
One more night I'll just have to take my chances  
And tomorrow we'll see  
A friend of mine he wound up dead  
His dress was stained the colour red  
No next of kin no fixed abode  
Another victim on this road  
The police just carted him away  
But someone took his place next day  
He was home by thanksgiving  
But not with the living  
Don't judge me  
You could be me in another life  
In another set of circumstances  
Don't judge me  
One more night I'll just have to take my chances  
And no it's just not in my plan  
For someone to care who I am  
I'm walking the streets for money  
It's the business of love, 'hey honey'  
C'mon, don't leave me lonely, don't leave me sad  
It'll be the sweetest five minutes you ever had

Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back  
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best  
He made a home in the wilderness  
He built a cabin and a winter store  
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore  
And the other travelers came walking down the track  
And they never went further, and they never went back  
Then came the churches, then came the schools  
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules  
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads  
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road  
  
Then came the mines, then came the ore  
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war  
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside  
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide  
Like a rolling river  
  
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze  
People driving home from the factories  
There's six lanes of traffic  
Three lanes moving slow  
  
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down  
I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found  
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed  
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed  
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles  
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold  
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code  
All the way down the telegraph road  
  
You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights  
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights  
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair  
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care  
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away  
From out of this darkness and into the day  
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain  
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names  
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane  
I've seen desperation explode into flames  
And I don't want to see it again  
  
From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""  
All the way  
Down the telegraph road

Still no letter at her door  
So she'll wash her flower curtains  
Hang them in the wind to dry  
Dust her tables with his shirt and  
Wave another day goodbye  
  
Marcie's faucet needs a plumber  
Marcie's sorrow needs a man  
Red is autumn green is summer  
Greens are turning and the sand  
All along the ocean beaches  
Stares up empty at the sky  
Marcie buys a bag of peaches  
Stops a postman passing by  
And summer goes  
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper  
Winter blows  
Up from the river there's no one to take her  
To the sea  
  
Marcie dresses warm its snowing  
Takes a yellow cab uptown  
Red is stop and green's for going  
Sees a show and rides back down  
Down along the Hudson River  
Past the shipyards in the cold  
Still no letter's been delivered  
Still the winter days unfold  
Like magazines  
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars  
Make a dream  
Dream back to summer and hear how  
He tells her  
Wait for me  
  
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us  
Where or why she moved away  
Red is angry green is jealous  
That was all she had to say  
Someone thought they saw her Sunday  
Window shopping in the rain  
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket  
And went west again

Confined and pecking at relationships

Ordinary people it's impossible to meet,  
Holding conversations that are always incomplete.

a Senator. From time to time you read something about him pinning a medal on
somebody or making a speech, or every now and then you read something in one
of those where are they now columns: Whatever became of Deanna Durbin and
Hubert Humphrey and so on.  
  
This became quite an issue last winter at the time of Winston Churchill's
funeral, when President Johnson was too ill to go and somebody suggested that
he send Hubert and he said, ""Hubert Who?"" ...and all America was singing:  
  
Whatever became of Hubert?  
Has anyone heard a thing?  
Once he shone on his own,  
Now he sits home alone  
And waits for the phone to ring.  
  
Once a fiery liberal spirit,  
Ah, but now when he speaks, he must clear it.  
Second fiddle's a hard part, I know,  
When they don't even give you a bow.  
  
""We must protest this treatment, Hubert"",  
Says each newspaper reader.  
As someone once remarked to Schubert,  
""Take us to your Lieder""...  
(Sorry about that.)  
  
Whatever became of you, Hubert?  
We miss you, so tell us, please:  
Are you sad? Are you cross?  
Are you gathering moss  
While you wait for the boss to sneeze?  
  
Does Lyndon, recalling when he was VP,  
Say ""I'll do unto you like they did unto me""?  
Do you dream about staging a coup?  
Hubert what happened to you?

I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host  
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts  
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast  
  
Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame  
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame  
If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame  
And though I'll never forget your face,  
sometimes I can't remember my name  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry  
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing  
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings  
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring  
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything  
  
Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said  
And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head  
And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead  
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't go  
Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep  
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep  
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep  
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep  
  
So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams  
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream  
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem  
But I'd sure like to find out  
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn  
Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you  
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  
  
When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor  
and orders another  
Well, I wonder what he did that for  
That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before  
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door  
  
We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars  
We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars  
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars  
You can see a million miles tonight  
But you can't get very far  
  
Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and  
Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but

All through Tecumseh valley  
But she asked around  
And a job she found  
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's  
  
She saved enough to get back home  
When spring replaced the winter  
But her dreams were denied  
Her pa had died  
The word come down from Spencer  
  
So she turned to whorin' out on the streets  
With all the lust inside her  
And it was many a man  
Returned again  
To lay himself beside her  
  
They found her down beneath the stairs  
That led to Gypsy Sally's  
In her hand when she died  
Was a note that cried  
Fare thee well  
Tecumseh valley  
  
The name she gave was Caroline  
Daughter of a miner  
Her ways were free  
It seemed to me  
That sunshine walked beside her

Somewhere in the wasteland of your head, oh  
Head, oh, head, oh, head, oh  
And make no mistake, my friend  
Your pointless life will end  
But before you go  
Can you look at the truth ?  
You have a lovely singing voice  
A lovely singing voice  
And all of those  
Who sing on-key  
They stole the notion  
From you and me

Hoping to find something better than  
I've got inside here

Don't throw away your playful beginning  
You and I will fumble around in the touches  
And be sure to...  
  
Leave all the lights on  
So we can see the black cat changing colors  
And we can walk under ladders  
And swim as the tide turns you around and around  
  
Hey we have found  
Becoming one in a million  
Slip into the crowd

Keep all your sights on  
The black cat changing colors

And swim as the tide choose to turn you  
  
And here I sit  
Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set  
Spot in the middle  
Static fade, statistic bit  
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away  
  
This I admit  
Taste so good, hard to believe an end to it  
Smell touch feel  
How could this rhythm ever quit  
Bags packed on a plane  
Hopefully to heaven  
  
Shut up I'm thinking  
I had a clue now it's gone forever  
Sitting over these bones  
You can read in whatever you're needing to  
  
Keep all your sights on  
The big bad black cat that's  
Changing colors  
  
It's not the colors that matter  
But that they'll all fade away  
  
This I admit  
Seems so full  
Hard to believe an end to it  
Warehouse is bare  
Nothing at all inside of it  
Walls and halls have disappeared, they've disappeared  
  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
My love I love to stay here  
In a corner was wondering...  
If a change could be better than this  
And then I worry  
Maybe things won't be better than they have been here  
Here in the warehouse  
  
At the warehouse  
How I love to stay here  
At the warehouse  
Every man and woman get alive  
  
That's our blood down there  
Seems poured from the hands of angels  
But trickle into the ground  
Leaves the warehouse bare and empty  
  
My heart's numbered beat  
Still echo in this empty room  
Fear wells in me  
But nothing seems enough to defend  
So I am going away...

People saying that you're no good for me,  
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""  
  
If you loved me baby you'd deny it,  
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,  
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand  
  
But you know that I'll forgive you,  
Just this once, twice, forever,  
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,  
Just as long as we're together.  
And you do  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want your freedom,  
I don't want to play around,  
I don't want nobody baby,  
Part time love just brings me down.  
I don't want your freedom,  
Girl, all I want right now is you.  
  
Like a prisoner who has his own key  
But I can't escape until you love me  
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys  
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do  
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you  
But you know that I'll forgive you  
Just this once twice forever  
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back  
Just as long as we're together  
And you do

If you like the way I'm thinkin' baby wink at it  
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat full 'a rhymes  
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it a  
Isn't it delicious crazy way that I'm kissin'  
Cause baby listen to this don't want to miss it while it's hittin'  
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in  
But don't ever quit so soon I'm gonna let you win but see  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You can vibe without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby I could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldn't be a let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge me by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I'm the geek in the pink pink pink  
I'm the geek in the pink yeah  
  
Well this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody  
But cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her  
Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter  
At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and a  
She was staring through the doorframe  
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend  
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then  
Cause I ain't comin' home, I don't need that attention, see  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You'll get by without me if you want

I am more than you're thinking  
Hey look at me go  
From hero to zero  
Oh take it from a geek like me  
I can save you from unoriginal dumb-dums  
Who wouldn't care if you com...plete him or not  
  
So what I've got a short attention span  
A coke in my hand  
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand  
Mm hip hop and flip flops it don't stop with the light rock  
A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot  
The hype is nothing more than hoo-hah so I'm  
Developing a language and I'm calling it my own  
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean  
That on the other side the grass is greener  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You'll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldn't be the let down

I'm the geek in the pink yeah  
I'm the geek in the pink  
All y'all it's the new color for fall

When things get rough some think it's easy to jump the ship . . .  
You decide  
I say--don't throw it away  
There's about a million reasons why  
Though you've heard them all before  
And you're getting very tired  
Lay your head on my lap and I'll sing you this lullaby  
CHORUS  
Don't you know  
That everyone around you  
Has felt the pain you feel today  
You're out of control yeah--and you want someone to tell you  
When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream  
You're out of control . . .  
There's a cloud-rollin' overhead and it seems to rain on no one else  
There's a black sun--casting a black shadow,  
And I know you feel so all alone  
You're out of control--and you want the world to love you  
Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know  
That you live and breathe and suffer  
And your back is in the corner and you've got nowhere to go  
Nothin' for nothin'--everything's right at your fingertips--for a price  
Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise  
I say--don't throw it away, you've got too many things to say  
If you throw your life, if you throw away your life . . .  
THe world will never be the same  
CHORUS  
You're out of control--and you move without direction  
And people look right through your soul  
You're out of control--and you want someone to tell you  
When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream  
And I wish that I could tell you, it'll only be a dream
